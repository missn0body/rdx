This is more of a breath of fresh air since my last projects
were complex C++ projects to make future projects for me easier,
so I've been itching to make a simple C terminal app again.

This program should essentially do what it says, as I imagine it
right now, convert a decimal to an arbitrary radix. In the future
I might change it so that it can convert an arbitrary radix to
arbitrary radix, but as for now, I will keep it simple.

My main method of developing applications currently is to do so
iteratively, make a baseline and then occasionally keeping at it
until it becomes something remarkable or until I can't keep etching
at it anymore. Some simple projects are going to be forever simple,
and it's bad practice to have a do-it-all program.

So that's most of what I want right now. 
The above is subject to change.
