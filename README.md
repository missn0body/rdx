# rdx

A terminal program to convert a decimal to arbitrary radix.  
Created in 2024 by anson.

This program does more or less exactly what it says. At the moment,
it will only accept decimal numbers as input. `rdx` will also always
assume that the first number given at the command-line is the number to
convert, and that the second is the base. In the future, maybe these
things will change.

Usage and options can be read by invoking `rdx --help` at the command line.
